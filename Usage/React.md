  React — Frontend Framework
</h1>

<p>
  React is the primary frontend framework used to build the Nethr dashboard.  
  It enables component-based user interfaces, efficient rendering, and a structured development flow.
</p>

## 📌 Why We Use React

React is chosen for the Nethr platform due to the following advantages:

- **Component Architecture**  
  Allows modular, reusable UI building blocks that scale as the platform grows.

- **Virtual DOM Efficiency**  
  Ensures smooth rendering, even with live monitoring and frequent UI updates.

- **Massive Ecosystem**  
  Rich support for charts, routing, state management, and third-party libraries.

- **Perfect synergy with TailwindCSS**  
  Accelerates styling while keeping the UI consistent.

- **Future-proof**  
  React supports large-scale production environments and long-term maintenance.

## 🧩 Usage in Nethr
